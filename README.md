# Tehran-AQI-prediction
This is a project which is written by Neural Network

IN this project according to specific contaminants like CO , O3 , NO2 ,... and AQI for all days and all 
stations in Tehran , we could predict values of AQI

During the project we used Neural Network model and famous libs in data sciencde like Pandas , Numpy , Tensorflow ,...

Attention : This code can be much better if domain expert hepls

Thanks to my teamate Mr.Ahmad Moghadam(AM)
